                    <p>This was a website I made individually for the second semester in my 
                      IT Minor class. It helped me develop my HTML and CSS skills and I 
                      learned what to do and not to do. </p>
                    <h3><a href="https://jwarwick03.github.io/ifsc-3342/final-project/index.html" target="_blank">Workout Website</a></h3>
                    <p>This website was my final in my Mobile Web Development class. 
                      I used the "mobile first" aproach to building this website and 
                      it helped me see why I should or shouldn't use this aproach. </p>

                      <p>This was an essay I wrote for my philosophy class that I took in 2022. 
                        It helped develop my writing skills along with using/citing sources 
                        to support my argument. </p>
                      <h3><a href="assets/files/American Lit Paper.pdf" rel="American Lit Paper" target="_blank">American Lit Paper</a></h3>
                      <p>This was a paper for my American Literacy class in 2022. 
                        I had to write about a piece of historical literature and 
                        explain what it was about. It helped me with being able to 
                        put my thoughts in words about a certain story. This paper 
                        enabled creativity along with critical thinking. </p>

                      <p>This was an assignment for a business class where I had to 
                        come up with a product and present it. This took a lot of 
                        creativity. </p>
                      <h3><a href="assets/files/Final Speech Portfolio.pdf" target="_blank">Speech Portfolio</a></h3>
                      <p>This was the final portfolio for my speech class that goes 
                        over all the speeches I had to give. It shows the public 
                        speaking I had to do and the class helped me become more 
                        comfortable with presentations. </p>

                     <p>This was a programming asignment for my IT Minor class. 
                      It involved using Javascript to show the value of a currency 
                      at a specific date in time. This gave me some good practice 
                      with Javascript. </p>
                     <h3><a href="https://jwarwick03.github.io/it-garnet/calculator/index.html" target="_blank">Javascript Calculator</a></h3>
                     <p>Another programming assignment for IT Minor that involved 
                      Javascript. It is a simple calculator that allows you to do a 
                      basic calculation of two numbers. This also helped me learn 
                      some basic Javascript. </p>

                      <p>This was an assignment from my IT Minor class that involved 
                        building a form that would send data to a database. It was a 
                        great learning experience for backend development. </p>

                      <p>Another project for IT Minor that was based on using API's to 
                        retrieve data to display. It was very helpful in giving me knowledge 
                        on API's and how to use them. </p>
